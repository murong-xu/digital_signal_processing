TUM EI Master Course "Digital Signal Processing [EI70220]"/ "Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing [EI7001]" in WS19/20.

This repository contains the assignment solutions.

Note:

* Scripts are adjusted from the original Matlab Grader. Hence, the code should be run section-by-section.
* The data used (images and video sequences) is available in the corresponding directory.

Assignment content: 

* Image manipulation and periodic sequences
* Image sampling and filtering
* DFT and block transform
* DCT and KLT transformations
* Autoregressive models and pyramids
* Subband decomposition and lifting
